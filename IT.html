                                       When I was younger my uncle would always take me to his mac and teach me the basics of programming. 
                                       I was enjoying this to a great degree until my free time became shorter and shorter, this resulted in my time with my uncle diminishing. 
                                       <br>
                                       <br>
                                       As time went on, I entered high school with a brain that was hardwired for algorithms, mathematics and logic. 
                                       English has always been my second language, (Egyptian being my first) this is also one of the reasons I’ve always done better in mathematics. 
                                       Regardless whether or not I’m “naturally good” at mathematics. It has always been my passion. It is the subjective laws and expectations that apply to this field that really grabbed my interest. 
                                       <br>
                                       <br>
                                       This then led onto me completing my mathematical methods to a VCE level at the age of fifteen,
                                       the only field that I could see me applying this passion to was IT. My father graduated with a computer science engineering degree, specialising in networking it would be assumed the he was the one that inspired me.
                                       This was never the case he never wanted me to get into this field. This was due to the terrible experience he had with the company he worked at, but he finally came to an agreement with me.

                           <h2>2. </h2>

                              <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h2>
                              
                              <p class="text-content">
                                 I chose Rmit because of its close proximity to where I live, it is centralised and in a prime location that can be accessed from the train station. 
                                 Another reason is due to the last two letters in this acronym, it is the institute of technology, this means It specialises in a certain educational field, 
                                 another reason is that I have no intention in getting an overload of unapplicable information in this area other universities may provide.

                              I only wish to learn what I need to be comfortable in this area, such as sufficient networking and database knowledge. I would love to come out with multiple language agility, understanding some SQL and SAP.
